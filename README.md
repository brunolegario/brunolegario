## Hi, I'm Bruno 👋

Front-end developer with **6 years of experience** building **web and mobile** applications. I also have an early foundation in **C++** from the first years of my career.

I graduated in **Architecture** at the **Federal University of Ceará**, including an exchange period at the **University of Valladolid**. That academic path introduced me to visual coding and sparked my transition into software development. Later, I strengthened this direction by studying **Digital Game Programming** at **Unisinos**.

I combine a strong sense of design with solid technical expertise to build user-friendly digital products that balance **aesthetics, functionality, and performance**. I value collaborative environments that foster innovation and diversity, and I’m motivated to bring a multidisciplinary perspective to new challenges in tech.
